# Spotify ad silencer

<img src="./logos/logo128.png"></img>

This is the repository for a Spotify Ad Silencer Chrome Extension.

Please read the [Chrome developer documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/) to understand the structure of the code.

**Original description:**
```
You want to listen to your favorite artists without being disturbed by annoying ads on Spotify?
You still want the artists to be paid for their work?

This light-weight extension mutes your tab when ads are running on Spotify online player.

NOTE: This extension only MUTES your tab : the ad will still be running, but you won't hear anything for the duration of the ad.
```

## Current state
The extension hasn't been working for a while (since a Google Chrome or Spotify update).

**Unfortunately, due to personal matters, I will not be able to maintain the extension anymore.**  

So I removed the extension from the Chrome web store (It was previously available [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lchpmljhgbcbmmihjoecchifkfmnpjhh)).
